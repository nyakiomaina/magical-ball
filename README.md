# Magical Ball zk-SNARKs Analogy
This project uses a metaphor of a color-changing ball to simplify the concept of zk-SNARKs.

## Overview
We have a magical ball that starts as blue. Using a secret command, the ball changes to green. The aim is to prove the ability to change the ball's color without revealing the command, mirroring the essence of zk-SNARKs: proving knowledge without revealing it.

## Running
Have rust and cargo installed, clone the repo and run `cargo run`
